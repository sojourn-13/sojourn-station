				<h1><a name="Prep">Prepping the expedition</a></h1>
				Every digsite I've been to, someone has forgotten something and I've never yet been to a dig that hasn't had me hiking to get to it - so gather your gear
				and get it to the site the first time. And most importantly if possible bring others. Share the workload and make an adventure that you and others can
				talk about later. Someone capable of doing medical work, Someone capable of protecting the group and of course. Someone able to dig up finds.<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Communication Equipment (HAM radios. These are your lifelines!)</li>
					<li>Medicinal Supplies (Someone always gets injured in someway.)</li>
					<li>Suspension Field Generator (No field generator means little to no finds.)</li>
					<li>Crates or Other Transport (You'll have alot to haul.)</li>
					<li>Weapons and Ammo (You'll need it.)</li>
					<li>Food (You will be crawling back starved without this.)
					<li>Base Camp Equipment (Only needed if actually staying out. Power supply Solars ect.)
				</ul><br>

				<h1><a name="Tools">Knowing your tools</a></h1>
				Every archaeologist has a plethora of tools at their disposal, but here's the important ones:<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Picks and pickaxes</b> - The bread and butter of your digging utensils. The big one works well on digging through rocks. While
					The small one works well on actually excavating things.</li>
					<li><b>Measuring tape</b> - don't leave home without it, you can use it to measure the depth you or someone else has dug.</li>
					<li><b>GPS</b> - helps others to find you if something bad happens.</li>
					<li><b>Core sampler</b> - use this to take core samples from rock faces, which you can then run to the lab for analysis.</li>
					<li><b>Depth scanner</b> - uses X-ray diffraction to locate anomalous densities in rock, indicating archaeological deposits.
						Comes with a handy reference log containing coordinates and time of each scan.</li>
					<li><b>Alden-Saraspova counter</b> - uses a patented application of Fourier Transform analysis to determine the difference between background and
						exotic radiation. Use it to determine how far you are from anomalous energy sources.</li>
					<li><b>Optical Mesons</b> - YOU WILL WANT THESE. These allow you to see far into the rocks. Helps to find the markings that stand out.
					Without these your basically digging blind till your right up on a find. They take small battery cells.</li>
					<li><b>Flashlight, floodlights or portable light source</b> - Self explanatory, I hope.</li>
					<li><b>Environmental safety gear</b> - This one's dependent on the environment you're working in, but enclosed footwear and a pack of internals
						could save your life.</li>
					<li><b>Anomaly safety gear</b> - A biosealed and catalysis-resistant suit along with eye shielding, tinted hood, and non-reactive disposable gloves are
					the best kind of protection you can hope for from the errors our forebears may have unleashed.</li>
					<li><b>Personal defence weapon</b> - Never know what you'll find on the dig: pirates, natives, ancient guardians, carnivorous wildlife...
						it pays in blood to be prepared.</li>
				</ul><br>

				<h1><a name="Find">Finding the dig</a></h1>
				Wouldn't be an archaeologist without their dig, but everyone has to start somewhere.<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Double <b>check your gear</b> then triple check it. Digs are a long walk away. Its not fun to find out you forgot something.</li>
					<li><b>Check with others</b> to see if someone would like to come with for expiditions outside. Less likly to happen when working the mines.</li>
					<li>Make sure to <b>notify your department</b> at the least that your heading out. Always let someone know where you are going.</li>
					<li><b>Do some digging.</b> - the earth mother isn't in the habit of displaying her secrets to the world (although sometimes you get lucky).
						Dig and clear away a bit of surface rock here and there, you never know what might be lurking below the surface.</li>
					<li><b>Tips on unearthing a deposit</b> - How do you know when you're golden? Look for telltale white strata that looks strange or out of place, or if
						something has broken under your pick while you're digging. Your depth scanner is your best friend, but even it can't distinguish between
						ordinary minerals and ancient leavings, if in doubt then err on the side of caution.</li>
				</ul><br>

				<h1><a name="Analyse">Analysing the contents of a dig</a></h1>
				You've found some unusual strata, but it's not all peaches from here. This is where most xenoarcheologists find trouble their first few times.<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Take core samples</b> - These are taken back to anomaly research to be scanned and turned into research points.</li>
					<li><b>Clear around any potential finds</b> - Clear away ordinary rock, leaving your prizes reachable in a clearly marked area.</li>
					<li><b>Haul off excess rock</b> - It's easy for a dig to get cluttered, and a neat archaeologist is a successful archaeologist.</li>
					<li><b>Don't be afraid to be cautious</b> - It's slower sometimes, but the extra time will be worth the payoff when you find a relic.</li>
					<li><b>Secure your site.</b> - Be vary careful of what is around you when your working. A voidwolf, animal or golem coming up on you when
						your working could spell a vary bad day.</li>
					<li><b>Double check your depth scanner</b> - The depth scanner can be misread if you start to press for speed. And you only get one to three
						finds at any particular site. Its better to slow down and recover all the finds at a location then to break half and have to look for more.</li>
				</ul><br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Excavate">Extracting your first find</a></h1>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Scan the rock</b> - Use a depth scanner to determine the find's depth and clearance. DON'T FORGET THESE.</li>
					<li><b>Choose stasis field</b> - The suspension field generator should be wrenched into place, facing the find and set to the appropriate field.
						A book on which setting is for which material type is provided by the lockers in the lower outpost.</li>
					<li><b>Do the math</b> - Here comes where most people have issues. The math. I will further explain it below in the next section. Please
						double check your math if you feel it might be off. You only get once chance at digging finds out.</li>
					<li><b>Digging to the bubble</b> - finds are generally in a softer bubble that you will dig to. The first section of math should bring you to this.</li>
					<li><b>Bracing the bubble. Getting the find.</b> - The suspension field will have to be turned on for this part. Once on, you want to dig the rest of
						the way to the anomaly. THIS MUST BE DONE IN ONE SHOT. If you don't do it in one shot you will get a strange rock or worse. Break the find.</li>
					<li><b>The dangerous ones.</b> - Sometimes, you'll chance upon something big, both literally and figuratively. Giant statues and functioning remnants of Precursor
						technology are just as exciting, to the right buyers. If your digging leaves a large boulder behind, dig into it bit by bit. But wear
						your anomaly suit and get ready. Anomalies can go off from the air once dug up.</li>
				</ul><br>

				<h1><a name="Maths">Every ones least favorite, Math</a></h1>
				<ul>
					<li><b>The first dig</b> - The formula for the overall process is below. You might have to look at the page a little differently to see it.</li>
					<li>(Find Depth - Depth Dug - Clerance)</li>
					<li>___________________________________</li>
					<li>------Divide the top part by 2-----</li>
					<li><b>The second dig</b> - For this part, The suspension field should be set and on. You'll dig this, then turn the field off.</li>
					<li>--Clerance---</li>
					<li>_____________</li>
					<li>-Divide by 2-</li>
					<li><b>But why?</b> - So why do we use this formula you might ask? Well lets go over it bit by bit for understanding.</li>
					<li><b>Depth</b> -  Depth of the find is how far the object we are trying to dig out is.</li>
					<li><b>Dug Depth</b> - Is how far we dug. Use the tape measure to find this one out.</li>
					<li><b>Clearance</b> - Is how big the bubble of soft material around the find is. We don't want it collapsing so we dig to this part,
						THEN dig the bubble itself only after we have started the suspension field.</li>
					<li><b>But why do we divide?</b> - All data on our depth scanner comes in CM. But the smallest amount we can dig with the pick is 2cm
						So to make sure we don't dig to far with the picks. We divide by two. Sense each "use" of the pick removes 2cm at a time.</li>
					<li><b>OH NO I MESSED UP!</b> - Sometimes you'll do your math wrong. It happens. If you went to far you might have broken your find.
						Not far enough or attempting to do two seperate digs into the bubble and you'll get a strange rock.
						Using a welder on it still might save it! But it could also crumble away. Wont know till you try.</li>
					<li><b>But wait theres more!</b> - If you dig out multiple finds and it suddenly shows something weird at 200 depth. Congrads.
						You found a anomaly! Dig to 200CM and it should break into a boulder. Excavate 2cm by 2cm till it crumbles away to reveal your
						potential death. Seriously. Wear your anomaly suit for this.</li>

				<h1><a name="Prep">Knowing your tool</a></h1>
				The suspension field is quite the bulky tool. Hated or loved by many, it's a critical piece for us to do xenoarch correctly.
				Xenoarch tends to be divided into types of actual finds. Our normal finds. Which we will simply continue to call such. And
				anomalies, which can be far more dangerous and due to not needing a suspension field wont be covered in this guide.

				The suspension field generator is capable of producing a net like field that holds things in place. We use this to keep our finds
				from collapsing in on itself while we finish the final part of digging it out. To accomplish this we must understand how we can interact
				with our equipment. The generator itself can be wrenched into place. And is powered by a large cell that it should have prepped inside
				at the beginning of the shift. Its locked to various ID's and will have to be swipped by your ID to unlock it. And finally, its got alot
				of various settings when unlocked. We will cover those below.
				Overall, it's a complicated piece with a lot of value.
				In my workplace we only have three of them. So, if your workplace is like mine, make sure to not lose them to the wildlife.
				Normally we keep two of them below ground near anomaly research's mine entrance. And one uptop by expidition prep.<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Heavy and Bulky.</li>
					<li>Requires wrench to get legs into place.</li>
					<li>Must be facing the right direction.</li>
					<li>Has to be unlocked with ID to get to settings.</li>
					<li>Requires a large cell in it. Make sure you have one in.</li>
					<li>Valuable piece of equipment. Don't lose it!</li>
				</ul><br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Setup">Setting up your generator</a></h1>
				Now let's assume you dragged that bulky generator all the way out to your digsite. Congrats, it's heavy.
				But now we have to get it against the dig itself. Make sure you have space for both the suspension field
				and you by the digsite. You'll have to dig a little more once its turned on after all. And of course, it
				should be facing the dig. Once in place wrench its legs down to brace it. And go ahead and swipe your ID
				to unlock it if you havn't already. Make sure to check your depth scanner for what to set it too. And
				if your not sure which setting is which. I have notes below for that.<br>
				<ul>

				</ul><br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Settings">Getting your settings right</a></h1>
				So now that we have a long list of settings, which one do we pick? Well, this takes a little memory. Or a handy guide on hand.
				For each outcome of what we find on our depth scanner there is a corresponding setting we put the Suspension Field Generator too.
				Below you'll see I have labeled six of them. But why only six? 'Cause that's the only ones you'll ever need. The others are for other
				fields of science that won't be covered on a xenoarch focused setup guide. Please take your time to learn these. Eventually you
				won't even need a book to refrence!<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Trace Organic Cells</b> - We use a Diffracted <b>Carbon Dioxide Laser</b>.</li>
					<li><b>Long Exposure Particles</b> - We slow the particles down with a <b>Potassium Refrigerant Cloud</b>.</li>
					<li><b>Crystalline Structures</b> - Trace around the crystals with a <b>Nitrogen Tracer Field</b>.</li>
					<li><b>Metallic Derivative</b> - Make sure you don't mix the two metals up. <b>Derivative takes Mercury Dispersion Waves</b>.</li>
					<li><b>Metallic Composite</b> - Make sure you don't mix the two metals up. <b>Iron Wafer Conduction for composites</b>.</li>
					<li><b>Unknown</b> - If you picked up unknown then something is normally wrong. Make sure to make a note for Mkne.</li>
				</ul><br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="End">Footnotes</a></h1>
				After setting up and getting your settings ready, go ahead and turn it on and finish your digging. Make sure to turn it off afterwards.
				But overall, please be careful with the equipment. It's bulky and heavy and annoying to haul around,
				but there is only so many of them. And they are needed for normal finds.
				Eventually youll get the settings down. Its a memorization thing.<br>

				<h1><a name="Analysis">Analysis progression</a></h1>
				Modern mass spectrometry requires constant attention from the diligent researcher in order to be successful. There are many different elements to juggle,
					and later chapters will delve into them. For the spectrometry assistant, the first thing you need to know is that the scanner wavelength is automatically
					calculated for you. Just tweak the settings and try to match it with the actual wavelength as closely as possible.<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Seal">Seal integrity</a></h1>
				In order to maintain sterile and environmentally static procedures, a special chamber is set up inside the spectrometer. It's protected by a proprietary vacuum seal
					produced by top tier industrial science. It will only last for a certain number of scans before failing outright, but it can be resealed through use of nanite paste.
					Unfortunately, it's susceptible to malforming under heat stress so exposing it to higher temperatures will cause it's operation life to drop significantly.<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Heat">Heat management</a></h1>
				The scanner relies on a gyro-rotational system that varies in speed and intensity. Over the course of an ordinary scan, the RPMs can change dramatically. Higher RPMs
					means greater heat generation, but is necessary for the ongoing continuation of the scan. To offset heat production, spectrometers have an inbuilt cooling system.
					Researchers can modify the flow rate of coolant to aid in dropping temperature as necessary, but are advised that frequent coolant replacements may be necessary
					depending on coolant purity. Water and substances such as cryoxadone are viable substitutes, but nowhere near as effective as pure coolant itself.<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Radiation">Ambient radiation</a></h1>
				Researchers are warned that while operational, mass spectrometers emit period bursts of radiation and are thus advised to wear protective gear. In the event of
					radiation spikes, there is also a special shield that can be lowered to block emissions. Lowering this, however, will have the effect of blocking the scanner
					so use it sparingly.<br>

				It's perhaps one of the most exciting times to be alive, with the recent breakthroughs in understanding and categorisation of things we may one day no longer call

				<h1><a name="Anomalies">Modern attitude towards anomalies</a></h1>
				It's only when confronted with things we don't know, that we may push back our knowledge of the world around us. Nowhere is this more obvious than the
				vast and inscrutable mysterious of the cosmos that scholars from such august institutions as the Elysian Institute of the Sciences present
				formulas and hypotheses for every few decades.<br>
				<br>
				Using our vast, telescopic array installations and deep space satellite networks, we are able to detect anomalous energy fields and formations in deep space,
				but are limited to those that are large enough to output energy that will stretch across light years worth of distance between stars.<br>
				<br>
				While some sectors (such as the Hydrolian Rift and Keppel's Run) are replete with inexplicable energetic activity and unique phenomena found nowhere else in
				the galaxy, the majority of space is dry, barren and cold - and if past experience has told us anything, it is that there are always more things we are
				unable to explain.<br>
				<br>
				Indeed, a great source of knowledge and technology has always been those who come before us, in the form of the multitudinous ancient alien precursors that
				have left scattered remnants of their great past all over settled (and unexplored) space.<br>
				<br>
				It is from xenoarchaeologists, high energy materials researchers, and technology reconstruction authorities that we are able to theorise on the gifts these
				species have left behind, and in some cases even reverse engineer or rebuild the technology in question. My colleague, Doctor Raymond Ward of the
				Tyrolian Institute on Titan, has made great breakthroughs in a related field through his pioneering development of universally reflective materials capable
				of harvesting and 'bottling' up virtually any energy emissions yet encountered by spacefaring civilisations.<br>
				<br>
				And yet, there are some amongst us who do not see the benefits of those who have come before us - indeed, some among them profess the opinion that there
				is no species that could possibly match humanity in it's achievements and knowledge, or simply that employing non-human technology is dangerous and unethical.
				Folly, say I. If it is their desire to throw onto the wayside the greatest achievements <i>in the history of the galaxy</i>, simply for preferment of the
				greatest achievements <i>in the history of mankind</i>, then they have no business in the establishment of science.<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Tri">Triangulating anomalous energy readings</a></h1>
				Strong energy emissions, when remaining constant from any one fixed location for millennia, can leave an 'imprint' or distinctive energy signature on other
				matter composites that are spatially fixed relative to the source.<br>
				<br>
				By taking samples of such 'fixed' matter, we can apply complex analytics such as the modified Fourier Transform Procedure to reverse engineer the path of the
				energy, and determine the approximate distance and direction that the energy source is, relative to the sample's point in space. Modern portable devices can do
				all this purely by taking readings of local radiation.<br>
				<br>
				A canny researcher can thusly analyse radiation at pre-chosen points strategically scattered around an area, and if there are any anomalous energy
				emissions in range of those points, combined the researcher can triangulate the source.<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Synthetic">Harvesting and utilising anomalous energy signatures</a></h1>
				As mentioned in the foreword, my colleague from the Tyrolian Institute on Saturn's moon of Titan, in the Sol System, Doctor Raymond Ward has made great strides
				in the area of harvesting and application of the energy emitted by anomalous phenomena from around the galaxy (although I profess I have not yet seen him
				venture further from his birthplace on Earth than the comfortable distance of the Sol Cis-Oort Satellite Sphere).<br>
				<br>
				By employing a patented semi-phased alloy with unique and fascinating bluespace interaction properties, Ward's contraption is able to 'harvest' energy, store
				it and redirect it later at will (with appropriate electronic mechanisms, of course). Although he professes to see or desire no commercial or material gain
				for the application and use of said energy once it is harvested, there are no doubt myriad ways we can come to benefit from such things beyond mere research,
				such as the reconstruction of torn cartilaginous tissue that a peculiar radiation from an amphibious species on Brachis IV was found to emit.<br>

				<h1><a name="Foreword">Foreword: A replacement for cryosleep?</a></h1>
				The development of rudimentary cryofreezing in the 20th and 21st centuries was hailed as a crank science by some, but many early visionaries recognised the
				potential it had to change the way we approach so many fields, such as medicine, therapeutics, and space travel. It was breakthroughs in the field in the 22nd and
				later centuries that turned the procedure from science fiction to science fact, however. Since then, cryogenics has become a hallmark of modern science, and
				regarded as one of the great achievements of our era. As with all sciences however, they have their time and are superseded by newer technological miracles when
				it is over.<br>

				<h1><a name="Development">The breakthrough</a></h1>
				It was in examining the effects of decelerated, bluespace, high energy particles when transphased through bluespace that the effects where primarily noticed.
				Due to exigent properties of that dimension, transphasing those particles capable of existing in bluespace with high stability levels has the effect of bringing
				some of those effects into realspace. Examining the Hoffman emissions in particular, it was discovered that they exhibited a-entropic behaviour, and in what is
				now termed the 'Effete Hoffman Principle,' it was found that metastabilising the Hoffman radiation resulted in the effect being applied across other physical
				interactions, in particular forces and reactions.<br>

				<h1><a name="Application">Applying this new principle</a></h1>
				When combined with an appropriate energy-effect replicate for cryogenics (slowing down biological activity, thus stabilising the organics), the effect is
				effectively identical to cryogenics, and while it consumes vastly more power and requires extremely complex equipment, it's (for all intents and purposes) superior
				to cryogenics, all that remains is to 'commercialise' the process by enabling cheaper development and mass production.<br>
				The Effete Hoffman Principle can be tweak-combined with other effects however, for different purposes. A division of PMC Research initially developed the application
				in prisons as a literal 'suspension field' where convicts are held immobile in the air, and the use quickly spread to numerous other areas.<br>
				<br>
				By examining the material resonance properties of certain strong waveforms when combined with Hoffman radiation, an effect was produced able to reverse energy
				transferral through matter, and to slow the effects of gravity. When combined with energy repulse technology, the triple effects compound themselves into a much
				stronger field, although all three components do slightly different things. High energy researchers assure me of the following key points:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>The energy repulsion factor provides a 'shell' capable of weak suspension.</li>
					<li>The Hoffman emissions nullify energy transferral and other kinetic activity, maintaining stability inside the field.</li>
					<li>The resonant waveform combines the effects of the above two points, and applies it magnified onto it's synced 'resonance' materials.</li>
				</ul>
				As an interesting aside, a carbon waveform was chosen for the field in prison suspension fields, due to it's resonance with organic matter.<br>
